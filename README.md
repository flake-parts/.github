# The flake-parts organization

Hello fellow Nixer ðŸ‘‹

This organization provides a place for future infrastructure around [flake-parts](https://flake.parts).

As flake-parts' main goal is to provide a common ground for otherwise disparate modules to be combined, you'll find that the interesting stuff happens elsewhere.

So in the spirit of flake-parts, we keep things kind of boring around here, so that you are free to innovate.

For now there's nothing here - how's that for ultimate modularity - but that may change. And when it does, expect it to:
  - be a service to everyone
  - treating modules equally
  - analytical content over opinionated content

Happy Nixing!
